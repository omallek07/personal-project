# personal-project

My personal project is called MyBooks.  It was inspired by GoodReads and is used to find, rate, and store all of the books that you have read into a visual database.  You can sort through your books by genre and authors, click on an individual book to see more details about it, and view other user's book collections to inspire about new books to read.  

Outside of using React, Redux, Express, Sequelize, and Node, I used the Google Books API to build a search form to retrieve data on a specific book and I used Semantic UI React to help stylize the UI layout and design of the app.
